Sequential layer allows to chain together a number of other layers.

# Usage

```julia

Concurrrent layer allows for stacking a number of other layers in parallel and
combining their results before returning it.

This layer will stack on the second last dimension.
So with 2D and 3D convolution this will be the channel layer (WxHxCxN). As a result
other dimensions have to the same.

Residual Layer works like a Sequential layer, however before returning the result
it will be combined with the orginal input (residual). This is a popular techique
